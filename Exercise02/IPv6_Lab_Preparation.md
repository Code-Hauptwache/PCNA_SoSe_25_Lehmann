## General Questions on IPv6

**Get familiar with the IP Version 6 address format! Answer the following questions and tasks:**

### a) IPv6 Address Format
**Question:** Explain the format that is used for IPv6 addresses and give the maximum number of devices that can be addressed!

**Answer:**
IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and written as eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv6 can support up to 2^128 addresses, which is enough for every device in the world.

### b) Communication Types in IPv6
**Question:** Explain the difference between Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast in IPv6! *(Prepare a diagram)*

**Answer:**
- **Unicast:** Message goes from one device to one specific device.
- **Multicast:** Message goes from one device to a selected group of devices.
- **Broadcast:** (Not used in IPv6! Instead, multicast is used. In IPv4, broadcast sends a message to all devices in the network.)

**Diagram:**

  A[Sender] -- Unicast --> B[Device 1]
  A -- Multicast --> C[Group of Devices]
  C1[Device 2]
  C2[Device 3]
  C3[Device 4]
  C --> C1
  C --> C2
  C --> C3
  A -- Broadcast (IPv4 only) --> D[All Devices]
```

### c) IPv6 Address Structure
**Question:** Explain the structure of IPv6 addresses and the terms Network Identifier, Interface Identifier, and Prefix Length! *(Prepare a diagram)*

**Answer:**
An IPv6 address has two main parts:

- **Network Identifier (network prefix):** Identifies the network (like a street name)
- **Interface Identifier:** Identifies the device on that network (like a house number)
- **Prefix Length:**
  - Shows how many bits are used for the network identifier
  - Written after a slash (/) â€” for example: /64

**Example:**
- `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334/64`
- `2001:0db8:85a3:0000` = network identifier (first 64 bits)
- `0000:8a2e:0370:7334` = interface identifier (last 64 bits)

**Diagram:**

    A --> C[Interface Identifier<br>Last 64 bits<br>0000:8a2e:0370:7334]
    A -.-> D[Prefix Length: /64<br>Indicates network portion size]
    
    B --> E[Used for routing<br>and network identification]
    C --> F[Uniquely identifies<br>host within network]
    D --> G[Separates network<br>from host portion]
```

### d) IPv6 Address Scope
**Question:** What is an IPv6 address scope? Name and explain the different scopes of IPv6! *(Prepare a table and diagram)*

**Answer:**
- **Link-local:** Used for communication on the same local network; not routable over the internet.
- **Unique local:** Like private addresses in IPv4 (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x); for internal use only.
- **Global unicast:** Can be routed worldwide; unique for every device on the internet.
- **Multicast:** Sends to multiple devices at once; scope set by address (e.g., link-local multicast).

**Scope Table:**
| Scope Name         | Description                                             | Example Prefix |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Link-local**     | Only valid within the same local network segment (link) | `fe80::/10`    |
| **Unique local**   | Valid within a site or organization (private networks)  | `fc00::/7`     |
| **Global unicast** | Valid everywhere (public internet, world-wide)          | `2000::/3`     |
| **Multicast**      | For one-to-many communication; scope varies by address  | `ff00::/8`     |

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[IPv6 Address Scopes]
    A --> B[Link-local<br>fe80::/10<br>Local network only]
    A --> C[Unique local<br>fc00::/7<br>Private networks]
    A --> D[Global unicast<br>2000::/3<br>Internet-wide]
    A --> E[Multicast<br>ff00::/8<br>Group communication]
```
